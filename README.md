Overview of the project. 

Project title:ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS
Data Collection
Acquire the Dataset: Obtain the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset or any other dataset of movie reviews. This dataset typically contains reviews labeled as positive or negative.
2. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Remove unwanted characters, punctuations, and correct misspellings.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Remove common words (e.g., 'the', 'is', 'in') that do not contribute to the sentiment.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form.
3. Data Splitting
Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Feature Extraction
Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
5. Model Training
Choose a Model: Select a machine learning model suitable for text classification, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Train the Model: Use the training data to train the model.
